# etch-a-sketch
In this project I will build a Etch-A-Sketch to improve my DOM manipulation skills. 

In additon to java I will try to style it with CSS to improve my styling skills to. 

To do list for the project:
- Setting up a new git repository
- Creating div for an 16x16 grid Etch-A-Sketch with JS 
- Using flexbox to positionthe boxes
- Using hover effect on the boxes
- Adding a button on the screen so that the user can choose the number of boxes for the new grid
- Setting a limit for maximum 100 boxes

Extras: Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares RGB values. And a dropdown color palette that can be choosed from the user for the grid color.
